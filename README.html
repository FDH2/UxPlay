developed at the GitHub site <a
href="https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay">https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay</a>
(where all user issues should be posted).</h3>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPLv3, open source.</li>
<li>Originally supported only AirPlay Mirror protocol, now has added
support for AirPlay Audio-only (Apple Lossless ALAC) streaming from
current iOS/iPadOS 15.5 clients. <strong>There is no support for
Airplay2 video-streaming protocol, and none is planned.</strong></li>
<li>macOS computers (2011 or later, both Intel and “Apple Silicon” M1
systems) can act either as AirPlay clients, or as the server running
UxPlay. Using AirPlay, UxPlay can emulate a second display for macOS
clients.</li>
<li>Support for older iOS clients (such as 32-bit iPad 2nd gen. and
iPhone 4S, when upgraded to iOS 9.3.5 or later), plus a Windows
AirPlay-client emulator, AirMyPC.</li>
<li>Uses GStreamer plugins for audio and video rendering (with options
to select different hardware-appropriate output “videosinks” and
“audiosinks”, and a fully-user-configurable video streaming
pipeline).</li>
<li>Support for server behind a firewall.</li>
<li><strong>New</strong>: Support for Raspberry Pi, with hardware video
acceleration using Video4Linux2 (vl42), which supports both 32- and
64-bit systems, unlike deprecated OpenMAX (omx), which is being dropped
by RPi distributions in favor of v4l2. (For GStreamer &lt; 1.22, a <a
href="https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/wiki/Gstreamer-Video4Linux2-plugin-patches">patch</a>
to the GStreamer Video4Linux2 plugin, available in the <a
href="https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/wiki">UxPlay Wiki</a>, is required,
unless your distribution has made a backport of changes from the
development branch.) See <a

reports</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is a GPLv3 open source unix AirPlay2 Mirror server for
Linux, macOS, and *BSD. It was initially developed by <a
href="http://github.com/antimof/Uxplay">antimof</a> using code from
OpenMAX-based <a href="https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay">RPiPlay</a>,
which in turn derives from <a
href="https://github.com/KqsMea8/AirplayServer">AirplayServer</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/juhovh/shairplay">shairplay</a>, and <a
href="https://github.com/EstebanKubata/playfair">playfair</a>. (The
antimof site is no longer involved in development, but periodically
posts updates pulled from the new main <a
href="https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay">UxPlay site</a>).</p>
<p>UxPlay is tested on a number of systems, including (among others)
Debian 10.11 “Buster” and 11.2 “Bullseye”, Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04, Linux
Mint 20.3, Pop!_OS 22.04 (NVIDIA edition), Rocky Linux 8.6 (a CentOS
successor), OpenSUSE 15.4, Arch Linux 5.16.8, macOS 12.3 (Intel and M1),
FreeBSD 13.1. On Raspberry Pi, it is tested on Raspberry Pi OS
(Bullseye) (32- and 64-bit), Ubuntu 22.04, and Manjaro RPi4 22.04.</p>
<p>Its main use is to act like an AppleTV for screen-mirroring (with
audio) of iOS/iPadOS/macOS clients (iPhones, iPads, MacBooks) in a
window on the server display (with the possibility of sharing that
window on screen-sharing applications such as Zoom) on a host running
Linux, macOS, or other unix. UxPlay supports Apple’s AirPlay2 protocol
using “Legacy Pairing”, but some features are missing. (Details of what
is publically known about Apple’s AirPlay 2 protocol can be found <a
href="https://openairplay.github.io/airplay-spec/">here</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/SteeBono/airplayreceiver/wiki/AirPlay2-Protocol">here</a>
and <a href="https://emanuelecozzi.net/docs/airplay2">here</a>).</p>
<p>The UxPlay server and its client must be on the same local area
network, on which a <strong>Bonjour/Zeroconf mDNS/DNS-SD server</strong>
is also running (only DNS-SD “Service Discovery” service is strictly
necessary, it is not necessary that the local network also be of the
“.local” mDNS-based type). On Linux and BSD Unix servers, this is
usually provided by <a href="https://www.avahi.org">Avahi</a>, through
the avahi-daemon service, and is included in most Linux distributions
(this service can also be provided by macOS, iOS or Windows
servers).</p>
<p>Connections to the UxPlay server by iOS/MacOS clients can be
initiated both in <strong>AirPlay Mirror</strong> mode (which streams
lossily-compressed AAC audio while mirroring the client screen, or in
the alternative <strong>AirPlay Audio</strong> mode which streams Apple
Lossless (ALAC) audio without screen mirroring. In
<strong>Audio</strong> mode, metadata is displayed in the uxplay
terminal; if UxPlay option <code>-ca &lt;name&gt;</code> is used, the
accompanying cover art is also output to a periodically-updated file
<code>&lt;name&gt;</code>, and can be viewed with a (reloading) graphics
viewer of your choice such as <code>feh</code>: run
“<code>uxplay -ca &lt;name&gt; &amp;</code>” in the background, then run
“<code>feh -R 1 &lt;name&gt;</code>” in the foreground; terminate with
“<code>ctrl-C fg ctrl-C</code>”. <em>Switching between</em>
<strong>Mirror</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>Audio</strong> <em>modes
during an active connection is possible: in</em> <strong>Mirror</strong>
<em>mode, stop mirroring (or close the mirror window) and start an</em>
<strong>Audio</strong> <em>mode connection, switch back by initiating
a</em> <strong>Mirror</strong> <em>mode connection; cover-art display
stops/restarts as you leave/re-enter</em> <strong>Audio</strong>
<em>mode.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note that Apple video-DRM (as found in AppleTV.app content
on the client) cannot be decrypted by UxPlay, and (unlike a true
AppleTV), the UxPlay server does not allow the Apple client to run a
http connection on the server that directly streams content from the
internet to the server, instead of streaming it to the client, and then
re-streaming to the server. Unlike AppleTV.app, DRM-free apps like
youtube.app can be viewed and listened to in Mirror mode, but using the
youtube.app icon for AirPlay video will only send ALAC sound without the
accompanying video.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3
id="possibility-for-using-hardware-accelerated-h264-video-decoding-if-available.">Possibility
for using hardware-accelerated h264 video-decoding, if available.</h3>
<p>UxPlay uses <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org">GStreamer</a>
“plugins” for rendering audio and video. This means that video and audio
are supported “out of the box”, using a choice of plugins. AirPlay
streams video in h264 format: gstreamer decoding is plugin agnostic, and
uses accelerated GPU hardware h264 decoders if available; if not,
software decoding is used.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>VAAPI for Intel and AMD integrated graphics, NVIDIA with
“Nouveau” open-source driver</strong></p>
<p>With an Intel or AMD GPU, hardware decoding with the open-source
VAAPI gstreamer plugin is preferable. The open-source “Nouveau” drivers
for NVIDIA graphics are also in principle supported: see <a
href="https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/VideoAcceleration.html">here</a>,
but this requires VAAPI to be supplemented with firmware extracted from
the proprietary NVIDIA drivers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NVIDIA with proprietary drivers</strong></p>
<p>The <code>nvh264dec</code> plugin (included in
gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad since GStreamer-1.18.0) can be used for
accelerated video decoding on the NVIDIA GPU after NVIDIA’s CUDA driver
<code>libcuda.so</code> is installed. (This plugin should be used with
options <code>uxplay -vd nvh264dec -vs glimagesink</code>.) For
GStreamer-1.16.3 or earlier, replace <code>nvh264dec</code> by the older
plugin <code>nvdec</code>, which must be built by the user: See <a
href="https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/wiki/NVIDIA-nvdec-and-nvenc-plugins">these
instructions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Video4Linux2 support for the Raspberry Pi Broadcom
GPU</strong></p>
<p>Raspberry Pi (RPi) computers can run UxPlay with software decoding of
h264 video but this usually has unacceptable latency, and
hardware-accelerated GPU decoding should be used. UxPlay accesses the
GPU using the GStreamer plugin for Video4Linux2 (v4l2), which replaces
unmaintained 32-bit-only OpenMax used by RPiPlay. Fixes to the v4l2
plugin that allow it to work with UxPlay on RPi are now in the GStreamer
development branch, and will appear in the upcoming GStreamer-1.22
release. A (partial) backport (as
<code>gstreamer1.0-plugins-good-1.18.4-2+~rpt1</code>) has already
appeared in RPi OS updates. Until the full update appears, or for other
distributions, you can find <a

instructions for GStreamer</a> in the <a

1.18.4 and later.</p></li>

<h3
id="note-to-packagers-openssl-3.0.0-solves-gpl-v3-license-issues.">Note
to packagers: OpenSSL-3.0.0 solves GPL v3 license issues.</h3>
<p>Some Linux distributions such as Debian do not allow distribution of
compiled GPL code linked to OpenSSL-1.1.1 because its license has some
incompatibilities with GPL code, unless all authors have given an
“exception” to allow such linking (the historical origins of UxPlay make
this impossible to obtain). Other distributions treat OpenSSL as a
“System Library” to which the GPL allows linking.</p>
<p>For “GPL-strict” distributions, UxPlay can be built using OpenSSL-
3.0.0, which has a new <a
href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2021/09/07/OpenSSL3.Final/">GPLv3-compatible
license</a>.</p>

<h2 id="building-uxplay-on-linux-or-bsd">Building UxPlay on Linux (or
*BSD):</h2>
<h3 id="debian-based-systems">Debian-based systems:</h3>
<p>(Instructions for Debian/Ubuntu; adapt these for other Linuxes; for
macOS, see below). See <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>
below for help with any difficulties.</p>
<p>You need a C/C++ compiler (e.g. g++) with the standard development
libraries installed. Debian-based systems provide a package
“build-essential” for use in compiling software. You also need
pkg-config: if it is not found by “<code>which pkg-config</code>”,
install pkg-config or its work-alike replacement pkgconf. Also make sure
that cmake&gt;=3.4.1 is installed:
“<code>sudo apt-get install cmake</code>” (add
<code>build-essential</code> and <code>pkg-config</code> (or
<code>pkgconf</code>) to this if needed).</p>
<p>Make sure that your distribution provides OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later, and
libplist 2.0 or later. (This means Debian 10 “Buster”, Ubuntu 18.04 or
later.) If it does not, you may need to build and install these from
source (see instructions at the end of this README). If you have a
non-standard OpenSSL installation, you may need to set the environment
variable OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR (<em>e.g.</em> ,
“<code>export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/lib64</code>” if that is where
it is installed).</p>
<p>In a terminal window, change directories to the source directory of
the downloaded source code (“UxPlay-*”, “*” = “master” or the release
tag for zipfile downloads, “UxPlay” for “git clone” downloads), then
follow the instructions below:</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> By default UxPlay will be built with
optimization for the computer it is built on; when this is not the case,
as when you are packaging for a distribution, use the cmake option
<code>-DNO_MARCH_NATIVE=ON</code>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libplist-dev</code> (unless
you need to build OpenSSL and libplist from source).</li>
<li><code>sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev</code>.</li>
<li><code>sudo apt-get install libx11-dev</code> (only needed if you
invoke the “ZOOMFIX” X11 display-name fix in the next step)</li>
<li><code>cmake .</code> (or “<code>cmake -DZOOMFIX=ON .</code>” to get
a screen-sharing fix to make X11 mirror display windows visible to
screen-sharing applications such as Zoom, see <a
href="#zoomfix-compile-time-option">ZOOMFIX compile-time option</a>
below). <strong>ZOOMFIX is only needed for GStreamer-1.18.x or
earlier</strong>.</li>
<li><code>make</code></li>
<li><code>sudo make install</code> (you can afterwards uninstall with
<code>sudo make uninstall</code> in the same directory in which this was
run).</li>
<li>Install GStreamer plugins that you need:
<code>sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-&lt;plugin&gt;</code>; values of
<code>&lt;plugin&gt;</code> needed are: “<strong>plugins-base</strong>”,
“<strong>libav</strong>” (for sound), “<strong>plugins-good</strong>”
(for v4l2 hardware h264 decoding) and “<strong>plugins-bad</strong>”
(for h264 decoding). Also needed may be “<strong>gl</strong>” for OpenGL
support (which may be useful, and should be used with h264 decoding by
the NVIDIA GPU), and “<strong>x</strong>” for X11 support, although
these may already be installed; “<strong>vaapi</strong>” is needed for
hardware-accelerated h264 video decoding by Intel or AMD graphics (but
not for use with NVIDIA using proprietary drivers). Also install
“<strong>tools</strong>” to get the utility gst-inspect-1.0 for
examining the GStreamer installation.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>If you intend to modify the code, use a separate “build”
directory: replace</em> “<code>cmake  [ ] .</code>” <em>by</em>
“<code>mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake [ ] ..</code>”; <em>you can then
clean the build directory with</em> “<code>rm -rf build/*</code>”
<em>(run from within the UxPlay source directory) without affecting the
source directories which contain your modifications</em>.</p>
<p>The above script installs the executable file “<code>uxplay</code>”
to <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, (and installs a manpage to somewhere
like <code>/usr/local/share/man/man1</code> and README files to
somewhere like <code>/usr/local/share/doc/uxplay</code>). It can also be
found in the build directory after the build processs.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, run uxplay in a terminal window</strong>. Use Ctrl-C
(or close the window) to terminate it when done. If it is not seen by
the iOS client’s drop-down “Screen Mirroring” panel, check that your
DNS-SD server (usually avahi-daemon) is running: do this in a terminal
window with <code>systemctl status avahi-daemon</code>. If this shows
the avahi-daemon is not running, control it with
<code>sudo systemctl [start,stop,enable,disable] avahi-daemon</code> (or
avahi-daemon.service). If UxPlay is seen, but the client fails to
connect when it is selected, there may be a firewall on the server that
prevents UxPlay from receiving client connection requests unless some
network ports are opened. See <a
href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> below for help with this or
other problems.</p>
<p><strong>One common problem involves GStreamer attempting to use
incorrectly-configured or absent accelerated hardware h264 video
decoding (e.g., VAAPI). Try “<code>uxplay -avdec</code>” to force
software video decoding; if this works you can then try to fix
accelerated hardware video decoding if you need it, or just uninstall
the GStreamer VAAPI plugin. If your system uses the Wayland compositor
for graphics, use “<code>uxplay -vs waylandsink</code>”.</strong> See <a
href="#usage">Usage</a> for more run-time options.</p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>: GStreamer-1.18.4 or later required for
hardware video decoding; for 1.20 or earlier, also see <a
href="https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/wiki/Gstreamer-Video4Linux2-plugin-patches">patching
instructions for GStreamer</a>. If “<code>uxplay</code>” by itself does
not work, use “<code>uxplay -v4l2</code>” (or use “<code>-rpi</code>” as
a synonym for “<code>-v4l2</code>”) on your desktop X11 system, and
optionally specify a videosink with “<code>-vs ..</code>”; use
“<code>uxplay -rpiwl</code>” as a synonym for
“<code>-v4l2 -vs waylandsink</code>” on a desktop system with Wayland
(this applies to recent Ubuntu). On a system without X11 that uses
framebuffer video (such as RPi OS Bullseye “Lite”) use
“<code>uxplay -rpifb</code>” as a synonym for
“<code>uxplay -v4l2 -vs kmssink</code>”. You can test UxPlay with
software-only video decoding using option <code>-avdec</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: to start UxPlay on a remote host (such as a Raspberry Pi) using
ssh:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>   ssh user@remote_host
   export DISPLAY=:0
   nohup uxplay [options] &gt; FILE &amp;</code></pre>
<p>Sound and video will play on the remote host; “nohup” will keep uplay
running if the ssh session is closed.<br />
Terminal output is saved to FILE (which can be /dev/null to discard
it).</p>

you need it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="building-uxplay-on-macos-intel-x86_64-and-apple-silicon-m1-macs">Building
UxPlay on macOS: <strong>(Intel X86_64 and “Apple Silicon” M1
Macs)</strong></h2>
<p><em>Note: A native AirPlay Server feature is included in macOS 12
Monterey, but is restricted to recent hardware. UxPlay can run on older
macOS systems that will not be able to run Monterey, or can run Monterey
but not AirPlay.</em></p>
<p>These instructions for macOS asssume that the Xcode command-line
developer tools are installed (if Xcode is installed, open the Terminal,
type “sudo xcode-select –install” and accept the conditions).</p>
<p>It is also assumed that CMake &gt;= 3.13 is installed: this can be
done with package managers <a
href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>, <a
href="http://finkproject.org">Fink</a> or <a
href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, or by a download from <a
href="https://cmake.org/download/">https://cmake.org/download/</a>.</p>
<p>First install OpenSSL and libplist: static versions of these libaries
will be used, so they can be uninstalled after UxPlay is built. These
are available in MacPorts and Homebrew, or they can easily be built from
source (see instructions at the end of this README; this requires
development tools autoconf, automake, libtool, which can be installed
using MacPorts, HomeBrew, or Fink).</p>
<p>Next get the latest macOS release of GStreamer-1.0.</p>
<ul>
<li>recommended: install the “official” GStreamer release for macOS from
<a
href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/">https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/</a>.
The alternative is to install it from Homebrew (MacPorts also supplies
it, but compiled to use X11).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the “official” release</strong>: install both the macOS
runtime and development installer packages. Assuming that the latest
release is 1.20.2. install
<code>gstreamer-1.0-1.20.2-universal.pkg</code> and
<code>gstreamer-1.0-devel-1.20.2-universal.pkg</code>. (If you have an
Intel-architecture Mac, and have problems with the “universal” packages,
you can also use <code>gstreamer-1.0-1.18.6-x86_64.pkg</code> and
<code>gstreamer-1.0-devel-1.18.6-x86_64.pkg</code>.) Click on them to
install (they install to /Library/FrameWorks/GStreamer.framework).</p>
<p><strong>For Homebrew</strong>: pkgconfig is needed (“brew install
pkgconfig”). Then “brew install gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good
gst-plugins-bad gst-libav”. This appears to be functionally equivalent
to using GStreamer.framework, but causes a large number of extra
packages to be installed by Homebrew as dependencies. <strong>You may
need to set the environment variable
GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0 to point to the Homebrew
GStreamer installation.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, build and install uxplay (without ZOOMFIX): open a terminal
and change into the UxPlay source directory (“UxPlay-master” for zipfile
downloads, “UxPlay” for “git clone” downloads) and build/install with
“cmake . ; make ; sudo make install” (same as for Linux).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On macOS with this installation of GStreamer, the only videosinks
available seem to be glimagesink (default choice made by autovideosink)
and osxvideosink. The window title does not show the Airplay server
name, but the window is visible to screen-sharing apps (e.g., Zoom). The
only available audiosink seems to be osxaudiosink.</p></li>
<li><p>The option -t <em>timeout</em> is currently suppressed, and the
option -nc is always used, whether or not it is selected. This is a
workaround for a problem with GStreamer videosinks on macOS: if the
GStreamer pipeline is destroyed while the mirror window is still open, a
segfault occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of glimagesink, the resolution settings “-s wxh” do
not affect the (small) initial OpenGL mirror window size, but the window
can be expanded using the mouse or trackpad. In contrast, a window
created with “-vs osxvideosink” is initially big, but has the wrong
aspect ratio (stretched image); in this case the aspect ratio changes
when the window width is changed by dragging its side.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Using GStreamer installed from MacPorts (not
recommended):</em></strong></p>
<p>To install: “sudo port install pkgconfig”; “sudo port install
gstreamer1-gst-plugins-base gstreamer1-gst-plugins-good
gstreamer1-gst-plugins-bad gstreamer1-gst-libav”. <strong>The MacPorts
GStreamer is built to use X11</strong>, so uxplay must be run from an
XQuartz terminal, can use ZOOMFIX, and needs option “-vs ximagesink”. On
an unibody (non-retina) MacBook Pro, the default resolution wxh =
1920x1080 was too large, but using option “-s 800x600” worked. The
MacPorts GStreamer pipeline seems fragile against attempts to change the
X11 window size, or to rotations that switch a connected client between
portrait and landscape mode while uxplay is running. Using the MacPorts
X11 GStreamer seems only possible if the image size is left unchanged
from the initial “-s wxh” setting (also use the iPad/iPhone setting that
locks the screen orientation against switching between portrait and
landscape mode as the device is rotated).</p>
<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>Options:</p>
<p><strong>-n server_name</strong> (Default: UxPlay);
server_name@_hostname_ will be the name that appears offering AirPlay
services to your iPad, iPhone etc, where <em>hostname</em> is the name
of the server running uxplay. This will also now be the name shown above
the mirror display (X11) window.</p>
<p><strong>-nh</strong> Do not append “<span class="citation"
data-cites="_hostname_">@_hostname_</span>” at the end of the AirPlay
server name.</p>
<p><strong>-s wxh</strong> (e.g. -s 1920x1080 , which is the default )
sets the display resolution (width and height, in pixels). (This may be
a request made to the AirPlay client, and perhaps will not be the final
resolution you get.) w and h are whole numbers with four digits or less.
Note that the <strong>height</strong> pixel size is the controlling one
used by the client for determining the streaming format; the width is
dynamically adjusted to the shape of the image (portrait or landscape
format, depending on how an iPad is held, for example).</p>
<p><strong>-s wxh@r</strong> As above, but also informs the AirPlay
client about the screen refresh rate of the display. Default is r=60 (60
Hz); r must be a whole number less than 256.</p>
<p><strong>-o</strong> turns on an “overscanned” option for the display
window. This reduces the image resolution by using some of the pixels
requested by option -s wxh (or their default values 1920x1080) by adding
an empty boundary frame of unused pixels (which would be lost in a
full-screen display that overscans, and is not displayed by gstreamer).
Recommendation: <strong>don’t use this option</strong> unless there is
some special reason to use it.</p>
<p><strong>-fs</strong> uses fullscreen mode, but only works with
Wayland or VAAPI plugins.</p>
<p><strong>-p</strong> allows you to select the network ports used by
UxPlay (these need to be opened if the server is behind a firewall). By
itself, -p sets “legacy” ports TCP 7100, 7000, 7001, UDP 6000, 6001,
7011. -p n (e.g. -p 35000) sets TCP and UDP ports n, n+1, n+2. -p
n1,n2,n3 (comma-separated values) sets each port separately; -p n1,n2
sets ports n1,n2,n2+1. -p tcp n or -p udp n sets just the TCP or UDP
ports. Ports must be in the range [1024-65535].</p>
<p>If the -p option is not used, the ports are chosen dynamically
(randomly), which will not work if a firewall is running.</p>
<p><strong>-avdec</strong> forces use of software h264 decoding using
Gstreamer element avdec_h264 (libav h264 decoder). This option should
prevent autovideosink choosing a hardware-accelerated videosink plugin
such as vaapisink.</p>
<p><strong>-vp <em>parser</em></strong> choses the GStreamer pipeline’s
h264 parser element, default is h264parse. Using quotes “…” allows
options to be added.</p>
<p><strong>-vd <em>decoder</em></strong> chooses the GStreamer
pipeline’s h264 decoder element, instead of letting decodebin pick it
for you. Software decoding is done by avdec_h264; various hardware
decoders include: vaapi264dec, nvdec, nvh264dec, v4l2h264dec (these
require that the appropriate hardware is available). Using quotes “…”
allows some parameters to be included with the decoder name.</p>
<p><strong>-vc <em>converter</em></strong> chooses the GStreamer
pipeline’s videoconverter element, instead of the default value
“videoconvert”. When using Video4Linux2 hardware-decoding by a
GPU,<code>-vc  v4l2convert</code> will also use the GPU for video
conversion. Using quotes “…” allows some parameters to be included with
the converter name.</p>
<p><strong>-vs <em>videosink</em></strong> chooses the GStreamer
videosink, instead of letting autovideosink pick it for you. Some
videosink choices are: ximagesink, xvimagesink, vaapisink (for intel
graphics), gtksink, glimagesink, waylandsink, osximagesink (for macOS),
kmssink (for systems without X11, like Raspberry Pi OS lite) or
fpsdisplaysink (which shows the streaming framerate in fps). Using
quotes “…” allows some parameters to be included with the videosink
name. For example, <strong>fullscreen</strong> mode is supported by the
vaapisink plugin, and is obtained using
<code>-vs "vaapisink fullscreen=true"</code>; this also works with
<code>waylandsink</code>. The syntax of such options is specific to a
given plugin, and some choices of videosink might not work on your
system.</p>
<p><strong>-vs 0</strong> suppresses display of streamed video, but
plays streamed audio. (The client’s screen is still mirrored at a
reduced rate of 1 frame per second, but is not rendered or displayed.)
This feature (which streams audio in AAC audio format) is now probably
unneeded, as UxPlay can now stream superior-quality Apple Lossless audio
without video in Airplay non-mirror mode.</p>
<p><strong>-v4l2</strong> Video settings for hardware h264 video
decoding in the GPU by Video4Linux2.</p>
<p><strong>-rpi</strong> Equivalent to “-v4l2”. Use for “Desktop”
Raspberry Pi systems with X11.</p>
<p><strong>-rpifb</strong> Equivalent to “-v4l2 -vs kmssink” (use for
Raspberry Pi systems using the framebuffer, like RPi OS Bullseye
Lite).</p>
<p><strong>-rpiwl</strong> Equivalent to “-v4l2 -vs waylandsink”, for
Raspberry Pi “Desktop” systems using the Wayland video compositor (use
for Ubuntu 21.10 for Raspberry Pi 4B).</p>
<p><strong>-as <em>audiosink</em></strong> chooses the GStreamer
audiosink, instead of letting autoaudiosink pick it for you. Some
audiosink choices are: pulsesink, alsasink, osssink, oss4sink, and
osxaudiosink (for macOS). Using quotes “…” might allow some parameters
to be included with the audiosink name. (Some choices of audiosink might
not work on your system.)</p>
<p><strong>-as 0</strong> (or just <strong>-a</strong>) suppresses
playing of streamed audio, but displays streamed video.</p>
<p><strong>-ca <em>filename</em></strong> provides a file (where
<em>filename</em> can include a full path) used for output of “cover
art” (from Apple Music, <em>etc.</em>,) in audio-only ALAC mode. This
file is overwritten with the latest cover art as it arrives. Cover art
(jpeg format) is discarded if this option is not used. Use with a image
viewer that reloads the image if it changes, or regularly (<em>e.g.</em>
once per second.). To achieve this, run
“<code>uxplay -ca [path/to/]filename &amp;</code>” in the background,
then run the the image viewer in the foreground. Example, using
<code>feh</code> as the viewer: run
“<code>feh -R 1 [path/to/]filename</code>” (in the same terminal window
in which uxplay was put into the background). To quit, use
<code>ctrl-C fg ctrl-C</code> to terminate the image viewer, bring
<code>uxplay</code> into the foreground, and terminate it too.</p>
<p><strong>-reset n</strong> sets a limit of n consecutive timeout
failures of the client to respond to ntp requests from the server (these
are sent every 3 seconds to check if the client is still present). After
n failures, the client will be presumed to be offline, and the
connection will be reset to allow a new connection. The default value of
n is 5; the value n = 0 means “no limit” on timeouts.</p>
<p><strong>-nc</strong> maintains previous UxPlay &lt; 1.45 behavior
that does <strong>not close</strong> the video window when the the
client sends the “Stop Mirroring” signal. <em>This option is currently
used by default in macOS, as the window created in macOS by GStreamer
does not terminate correctly (it causes a segfault) if it is still open
when the GStreamer pipeline is closed.</em></p>
<p><strong>-FPSdata</strong> Turns on monitoring of regular reports
about video streaming performance that are sent by the client. These
will be displayed in the terminal window if this option is used. The
data is updated by the client at 1 second intervals.</p>
<p><strong>-fps n</strong> sets a maximum frame rate (in frames per
second) for the AirPlay client to stream video; n must be a whole number
less than 256. (The client may choose to serve video at any frame rate
lower than this; default is 30 fps.) A setting below 30 fps might be
useful to reduce latency if you are running more than one instance of
uxplay at the same time. <em>This setting is only an advisory to the
client device, so setting a high value will not force a high
framerate.</em> (You can test using “-vs fpsdisplaysink” to see what
framerate is being received, or use the option -FPSdata which displays
video-stream performance data continuously sent by the client during
video-streaming.)</p>
<p><strong>-f {H|V|I}</strong> implements “videoflip” image transforms:
H = horizontal flip (right-left flip, or mirror image); V = vertical
flip ; I = 180 degree rotation or inversion (which is the combination of
H with V).</p>
<p><strong>-r {R|L}</strong> 90 degree Right (clockwise) or Left
(counter-clockwise) rotations; these image transforms are carried out
after any <strong>-f</strong> transforms.</p>
<p><strong>-m</strong> generates a random MAC address to use instead of
the true hardware MAC number of the computer’s network card. (Different
server_name, MAC addresses, and network ports are needed for each
running uxplay if you attempt to run two instances of uxplay on the same
computer.) If UxPlay fails to find the true MAC address of a network
card, (more specifically, the MAC address used by the first active
network interface detected) a random MAC address will be used even if
option <strong>-m</strong> was not specifed. (Note that a random MAC
address will be different each time UxPlay is started).</p>
<p><strong>-t <em>timeout</em></strong> will cause the server to
relaunch (without stopping uxplay) if no connections have been present
during the previous <em>timeout</em> seconds. You may wish to use this
if the Server is not visible to new Clients that were inactive when the
Server was launched, and an idle Bonjour registration eventually becomes
unavailable for new connections (this is a workaround for what may be
due to a problem with your DNS-SD or Avahi setup). <em>This option is
currently disabled in macOS, for the same reason that requires the -nc
option.</em></p>
<p><strong>-vdmp</strong> Dumps h264 video to file videodump.h264. -vdmp
n dumps not more than n NAL units to videodump.x.h264; x= 1,2,…
increases each time a SPS/PPS NAL unit arrives. To change the name
<em>videodump</em>, use -vdmp [n] <em>filename</em>.</p>
<p><strong>-admp</strong> Dumps audio to file audiodump.x.aac (AAC-ELD
format audio), audiodump.x.alac (ALAC format audio) or audiodump.x.aud
(other-format audio), where x = 1,2,3… increases each time the audio
format changes. -admp <em>n</em> restricts the number of packets dumped
to a file to <em>n</em> or less. To change the name <em>audiodump</em>,
use -admp [n] <em>filename</em>.</p>
<p><strong>-d</strong> Enable debug output. Note: this does not show
GStreamer error or debug messages. To see GStreamer error and warning
messages, set the environment variable GST_DEBUG with “export
GST_DEBUG=2” before running uxplay. To see GStreamer debug messages, set
GST_DEBUG=4; increase this to see even more of the GStreamer inner
workings.</p>

<h3 id="problems-in-compiling-uxplay.">0. Problems in compiling
UxPlay.</h3>
<p>One user (on Ubuntu) found compilation failed with messages about
linking to “usr/local/lib/libcrypto.a” and “zlib”. This was because (in
addition to the standard ubuntu installation of libssl-dev), the user
was unaware that a second installation with libcrypto in /usr/local was
present. Solution: when more than one installation of OpenSSL is
present, set the environment variable OPEN_SSL_ROOT_DIR to point to the
correct one; on 64-bit Ubuntu, this is done by running
<code>export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/lib/X86_64-linux-gnu/</code> before
running cmake.</p>
<h3

uxplay starts, but stalls after “Initialized server socket(s)” appears,
<em>without any server name showing on the client</em>.</h3>
<p>Stalling this way, with <em>no</em> server name showing <em>on the
client</em> as available, probably means that your network <strong>does
not have a running Bonjour/zeroconf DNS-SD server.</strong> On Linux,
make sure Avahi is installed, and start the avahi-daemon service on the
system running uxplay (your distribution will document how to do this).
Some systems may instead use the mdnsd daemon as an alternative to
provide DNS-SD service. <em>(FreeBSD offers both alternatives, but only
Avahi was tested: one of the steps needed for getting Avahi running on a
FreeBSD system is to edit
<code>/usr/local/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf</code> to uncomment a line
for airplay support.</em>)</p>
<p>After starting uxplay, use the utility
<code>avahi-browse -a -t</code> in a different terminal window on the
server to verify that the UxPlay AirTunes and AirPlay services are
correctly registered (only the AirTunes service is used in the “Legacy”
AirPlay Mirror mode used by UxPlay). If the UxPlay service is listed by
avahi-browse, but is not seen by the client, the problem is likely to be
a problem with the local network.</p>

uxplay starts, but stalls after “Initialized server socket(s)” appears,
<em>with the server name showing on the client</em> (but the client
fails to connect when the UxPlay server is selected).</h3>
<p>This shows that a <em>DNS-SD</em> service is working, but a firewall
on the server is probably blocking the connection request from the
client. (One user who insisted that the firewall had been turned off
turned out to have had <em>two</em> active firewalls (<em>firewalld</em>
and <em>ufw</em>) <em>both</em> running on the server!) If possible,
either turn off the firewall to see if that is the problem, or get three
consecutive network ports, starting at port n, all three in the range
1024-65535, opened for both tcp and udp, and use “uxplay -p n” (or open
UDP 6000, 6001, 6011 TCP 7000,7001,7100 and use “uxplay -p”).</p>
<h3 id="problems-after-the-client-server-connection-has-been-made">3.
Problems <em>after</em> the client-server connection has been made:</h3>
<p>If you do <em>not</em> see the message
<code>raop_rtp_mirror starting mirroring</code>, something went wrong
before the client-server negotiations were finished. For such problems,
use “uxplay -d” (debug log option) to see what is happening: it will
show how far the connection process gets before the failure occurs. You
can compare your debug output to that from a successful start of UxPlay
in the <a href="https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/wiki">UxPlay
Wiki</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If UxPlay reports that mirroring started, but you get no
video or audio, the problem is probably from a GStreamer plugin that
doesn’t work on your system</strong> (by default, GStreamer uses the
“autovideosink” and “autoaudiosink” algorithms to guess what are the
“best” plugins to use on your system).</p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> devices (-rpi option) only work with
hardware GPU decoding if the Video4Linux2 plugin in GStreamer v1.20.x or
earlier has been patched (see the UxPlay <a
href="https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/wiki/Gstreamer-Video4Linux2-plugin-patches">Wiki</a>
for patches). This may be fixed in the future when GStreamer-1.22 is
released, or by backport patches in distributions such as Raspberry Pi
OS (Bullseye).</p>
<p>Sometimes “autovideosink” may select the OpenGL renderer
“glimagesink” which may not work correctly on your system. Try the
options “-vs ximagesink” or “-vs xvimagesink” to see if using one of
these fixes the problem.</p>
<p>Other reported problems are connected to the GStreamer VAAPI plugin
(for hardware-accelerated Intel graphics, but not NVIDIA graphics). Use
the option “-avdec” to force software h264 video decoding: this should
prevent autovideosink from selecting the vaapisink videosink.
Alternatively, find out if the gstreamer1.0-vaapi plugin is installed,
and if so, uninstall it. (If this does not fix the problem, you can
reinstall it.)</p>
<p>There are some reports of other GStreamer problems with
hardware-accelerated Intel HD graphics. One user (on Debian) solved this
with “sudo apt install intel-media-va-driver-non-free”. This is a driver
for 8’th (or later) generation “*-lake” Intel chips, that seems to be
related to VAAPI accelerated graphics.</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> have Intel HD graphics, and have installed the
vaapi plugin, but <code>-vs vaapisink</code> does not work, check that
vaapi is not “blacklisted” in your GStreamer installation: run
<code>gst-inspect-1.0 vaapi</code>, if this reports
<code>0 features</code>, you need to
<code>export GST_VAAPI_ALL_DRIVERS=1</code> before running uxplay, or
set this in the default environment.</p>
<p>You can try to fix audio problems by using the “-as
<em>audiosink</em>” option to choose the GStreamer audiosink , rather
than have autoaudiosink pick one for you. The command “gst-inspect-1.0 |
grep Sink | grep Audio” ” will show you which audiosinks are available
on your system. (Replace “Audio” by “Video” to see videosinks). Some
possible audiosinks are pulsesink, alsasink, osssink, oss4sink, and
osxaudiosink (macOS).</p>
<p>If you ran cmake with “-DZOOMFIX=ON”, check if the problem is still
there without ZOOMFIX. ZOOMFIX is only applied to the default videosink
choice (“autovideosink”) and the two X11 videosinks “ximagesink” and
“xvimagesink”. ZOOMFIX is only designed for these last two; if
autovideosink chooses a different videosink, ZOOMFIX is now ignored. If
you are using the X11 windowing system (standard on Linux), and have
trouble with screen-sharing on Zoom, use ZOOMFIX and “-vs xvimagesink”
(or “-vs ximagesink” if the previous choice doesn’t work).</p>
<p>As other videosink choices are not affected by ZOOMFIX, they may or
may not be visible to screen-sharing apps. Cairo-based windows created
on Linux with “-vs gtksink” are visible to screen-sharing aps without
ZOOMFIX; windows on macOS created by “-vs glimagesink” (default choice)
and “-vs osximagesink” are also visible.</p>
<p>The “OpenGL renderer” window created on Linux by “-vs glimagesink”
sometimes does not close properly when its “close” button is clicked.
(this is a GStreamer issue). You may need to terminate uxplay with
Ctrl-C to close a “zombie” OpenGl window. If similar problems happen
when the client sends the “Stop Mirroring” signal, try the no-close
option “-nc” that leaves the video window open.</p>
<h3 id="gstreamer-issues-missing-plugins-etc.">4. GStreamer issues
(missing plugins, etc.):</h3>
<p>To troubleshoot GStreamer execute “export GST_DEBUG=2” to set the
GStreamer debug-level environment-variable in the terminal where you
will run uxplay, so that you see warning and error messages; see <a
href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/debugging-tools.html">GStreamer
debugging tools</a> for how to see much more of what is happening inside
GStreamer. Run “gst-inspect-1.0” to see which GStreamer plugins are
installed on your system.</p>
<p>Some extra GStreamer packages for special plugins may need to be
installed (or reinstalled: a user using a Wayland display system as an
alternative to X11 reported that after reinstalling Lubuntu 18.4, UxPlay
would not work until gstreamer1.0-x was installed, presumably for
Wayland’s X11-compatibility mode). Different distributions may break up
GStreamer 1.x into packages in different ways; the packages listed above
in the build instructions should bring in other required GStreamer
packages as dependencies, but will not install all possible plugins.</p>
<p>The GStreamer video pipeline, which is shown in the initial output
from <code>uxplay -d</code>, has the default form</p>
<pre><code>appsrc name=video_source ! queue ! h264parse ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! autovideosink name=video_sink sync=false</code></pre>
<p>The pipeline is fully configurable: default elements “h264parse”,
“decodebin”, “videoconvert”, and “autovideosink” can respectively be
replaced by using uxplay options <code>-vp</code>, <code>-vd</code>,
<code>-vc</code>, and <code>-vs</code>, if there is any need to modify
it (entries can be given in quotes “…” to include options).</p>
<h3 id="mirror-screen-freezes">5. Mirror screen freezes:</h3>
<p>This can happen if the TCP video stream from the client stops
arriving at the server, probably because of network problems (the UDP
audio stream may continue to arrive). At 3-second intervals, UxPlay
checks that the client is still connected by sending it a request for a
NTP time signal. If a reply is not received from the client within a 0.3
sec time-window, an “ntp timeout” is registered. If a certain number
(currently 5) of consecutive ntp timeouts occur, UxPlay assumes that the
client is “dead”, and resets the connection, becoming available for
connection to a new client, or reconnection to the previous one.
Sometimes the connection may recover before the timeout limit is
reached, and if the default limit is not right for your network, it can
be modified using the option “-reset <em>n</em>”, where <em>n</em> is
the desired timeout-limit value (<em>n</em> = 0 means “no limit”). If
the connection starts to recover after ntp timeouts, a corrupt video
packet from before the timeout may trigger a “connection reset by peer”
error, which also causes UxPlay to reset the connection. When the
connection is reset, the “frozen” mirror screen of the previous
connection is left in place, and will be taken over by a new client
connection when it is made.</p>
<h3
id="protocol-issues-such-as-failure-to-decrypt-all-video-and-audio-streams-from-old-or-non-apple-clients">6.
Protocol issues, such as failure to decrypt ALL video and audio streams
from old or non-Apple clients:</h3>
<p>A protocol failure may trigger an unending stream of error messages,
and means that the audio decryption key (also used in video decryption)
was not correctly extracted from data sent by the client. This should
not happen for iOS 9.3 or later clients. However, if a client uses the
same older version of the protocol that is used by the Windows-based
AirPlay client emulator <em>AirMyPC</em>, the protocol can be switched
to the older version by the setting
<code>OLD_PROTOCOL_CLIENT_USER_AGENT_LIST</code> in
<code>UxPlay/lib/global.h</code>. UxPlay reports the client’s “User
Agent” string when it connects. If some other client also fails to
decrypt all audio and video, try adding its “User Agent” string in place
of “xxx” in the entry “AirMyPC/2.0;xxx” in global.h and rebuild
uxplay.</p>
<p>Note that Uxplay declares itself to be an AppleTV3,2 with a
sourceVersion 220.68; this can also be changed in global.h. It had been
thought that it was necessary for UxPlay to claim to be an older 32 bit
AppleTV model that cannot run modern 64bit tvOS, in order for the client
to use a “legacy” protocol for pairing with the server (see the
<em>“Notes on AirPlay protocol versions”</em> at the end of this
README). However, UxPlay still works if it declares itself as an
AppleTV6,2 with sourceVersion 380.20.1 (an AppleTV 4K 1st gen,
introduced 2017, running tvOS 12.2.1); it seems that the use of “legacy”
protocol just requires bit 27 (listed as “SupportsLegacyPairing”) of the
“features” plist code (reported to the client by the AirPlay server) to
be set. The “features” code and other settings are set in
<code>UxPlay/lib/dnssdint.h</code>.</p>
<h1 id="changelog">ChangeLog</h1>
<p>1.54 2022-06-25 Add support for “Cover Art” display in Audio-only
(ALAC) mode. Reverted a change that caused VAAPI to crash with AMD
POLARIS graphics cards. Minor internal changes to plist code and uxplay
option parsing.</p>
<p>1.53 2022-06-13 Internal changes to audio sync code, revised
documentation, Minor bugfix (fix assertion crash when resent audio
packets are empty).</p>
<p>1.52 2022-05-05 Cleaned up initial audio sync code, and reformatted
streaming debug output (readable aligned timestamps with decimal points
in seconds). Eliminate memory leaks (found by valgrind). Support for
display of ALAC (audio-only) metadata (soundtrack artist names, titles
etc.) in the uxplay terminal.</p>
<p>1.51 2022-04-24 Reworked options forVideo4Linux2 support (new option
-v4l2) and short options -rpi, -rpifb, -rpiwl as synonyms for -v4l2,
-v4l2 -vs kmssink, and -v4l2 -vs waylandsink. Reverted a change from
1.48 that broke reconnection after “Stop Mirroring” is sent by
client.</p>
<p>1.50 2022-04-22 Added -fs fullscreen option (for Wayland or VAAPI
plugins only), Changed -rpi to be for framebuffer (“lite”) RPi systems
and added -rpigl (OpenGL) and -rpiwl (Wayland) options for RPi Desktop
systems. Also modified timestamps from “DTS” to “PTS” for latency
improvement, plus internal cleanups.</p>
<p>1.49 2022-03-28 Addded options for dumping video and/or audio to
file, for debugging, etc. h264 PPS/SPS NALU’s are shown with -d. Fixed
video-not-working for M1 Mac clients.</p>
<p>1.48 2022-03-11 Made the GStreamer video pipeline fully configurable,
for use with hardware h264 decoding. Support for Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>1.47 2022-02-05 Added -FPSdata option to display (in the terminal)
regular reports sent by the client about video streaming performance.
Internal cleanups of processing of video packets received from the
client. Added -reset n option to reset the connection after n ntp
timeouts (also reset after “connection reset by peer” error in video
stream).</p>
<p>1.46 2022-01-20 Restore pre-1.44 behavior (1.44 may have broken
hardware acceleration): once again use decodebin in the video pipeline;
introduce new option “-avdec” to force software h264 decoding by libav
h264, if needed (to prevent selection of vaapisink by autovideosink).
Update llhttp to v6.0.6. UxPlay now reports itself as AppleTV3,2.
Restrict connections to one client at a time (second client must now
wait for first client to disconnect).</p>
<p>1.45 2022-01-10 New behavior: close video window when client requests
“stop mirroring”. (A new “no close” option “-nc” is added for users who
wish to retain previous behavior that does not close the video
window).</p>
<p>1.44 2021-12-13 Omit hash of aeskey with ecdh_secret for an AirMyPC
client; make an internal rearrangement of where this hash is done. Fully
report all initial communications between client and server in -d debug
mode. Replace decodebin in GStreamer video pipeline by h264-specific
elements.</p>
<p>1.43 2021-12-07 Various internal changes, such as tests for
successful decryption, uniform treatment of informational/debug
messages, etc., updated README.</p>

fix, show request Plists in debug mode.</p>
<p>1.39 2021-11-06 Added support for Apple Lossless (ALAC) audio
streams.</p>
<p>1.38 2021-10-8 Add -as <em>audiosink</em> option to allow user to
choose the GStreamer audiosink.</p>
<p>1.37 2021-09-29 Append “<span class="citation"
data-cites="hostname">@hostname</span>” to AirPlay Server name, where
“hostname” is the name of the server running uxplay (reworked change in
1.36).</p>
<p>1.36 2021-09-29 Implemented suggestion (by <span class="citation"
data-cites="mrbesen">@mrbesen</span> and <span class="citation"
data-cites="PetrusZ">@PetrusZ</span>) to use hostname of machine runing
uxplay as the default server name</p>
<p>1.35.1 2021-09-28 Added the -vs 0 option for streaming audio, but not
displaying video.</p>
<p>1.35 2021-09-10 now uses a GLib MainLoop, and builds on macOS (tested
on Intel Mac, 10.15 ). New option -t <em>timeout</em> for relaunching
server if no connections were active in previous <em>timeout</em>
seconds (to renew Bonjour registration).</p>
<p>1.341 2021-09-04 fixed: render logger was not being destroyed by
stop_server()</p>
<p>1.34 2021-08-27 Fixed “ZOOMFIX”: the X11 window name fix was only
being made the first time the GStreamer window was created by uxplay,
and not if the server was relaunched after the GStreamer window was
closed, with uxplay still running. Corrected in v. 1.34</p>
<h3 id="zoomfix-compile-time-option">ZOOMFIX compile-time option</h3>
<p>In GStreamer-1.18.6 and earlier, if UxPlay is using an X11 window for
screen mirroring, this window is not visible to screen-sharing apps like
ZOOM. OpenGL-based windows (use <code>-vs glimagesink</code> or
<code>-vs gtksink</code>, <em>etc.</em>) do not have this problem.</p>
<p>A workaround is to manually make the X11 window visible to
screen-sharing apps with the X11 utility xdotool, if it is installed,
with: <code>xdotool selectwindow set_window --name &lt;name&gt;</code>
(where <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is your choice of name), and then
select the uxplay window by clicking on it with the mouse.</p>
<p>However, if “<code>cmake -DZOOMFIX=ON .</code>” is run before
compiling, the mirrored window is visible to screen-sharing
applications, without this procedure. To compile with ZOOMFIX=ON, the
X11 development libraries must be installed. (Without ZOOMFIX, UxPlay
has no dependence on X11).</p>
<p><strong>ZOOMFIX is not needed in GStreamer-1.20 or later.</strong>
Thanks to David Ventura https://github.com/DavidVentura/UxPlay for the
fix and also for getting a fix into gstreamer-1.20.</p>

<p>If you need to do this, note that you may be able to use a newer
version (OpenSSL-3.0.1 is known to work). You will need the standard
development toolset (autoconf, automake, libtool). Download the source
code from <a
href="https://www.openssl.org/source/">https://www.openssl.org/source/</a>.
Install the downloaded openssl by opening a terminal in your Downloads
directory, and unpacking the source distribution: (“tar -xvzf
openssl-3.0.1.tar.gz ; cd openssl-3.0.1”). Then build/install with
“./config ; make ; sudo make install_dev”. This will typically install
the needed library <code>libcrypto.*</code>, either in /usr/local/lib or
/usr/local/lib64.</p>
<p><em>(Ignore the following for builds on MacOS:)</em> On some systems
like Debian or Ubuntu, you may also need to add a missing entry
<code>/usr/local/lib64</code> in /etc/ld.so.conf (or place a file
containing “/usr/local/lib64/libcrypto.so” in /etc/ld.so.conf.d) and
then run “sudo ldconfig”.</p>
<h3 id="building-libplist-2.0.0-from-source.">Building libplist &gt;=
2.0.0 from source.</h3>
<p><em>(Note: on Debian 9 “Stretch” or Ubuntu 16.04 LTS editions, you
can avoid this step by installing libplist-dev and libplist3 from Debian
10 or Ubuntu 18.04.)</em> As well as the usual build tools (autoconf,
automake, libtool), you may need to also install some libpython*-dev
package. Download the latest source from <a
href="https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libplist">https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libplist</a>:
get <a
href="https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libplist/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">libplist-master.zip</a>,
then (“unzip libplist-master.zip ; cd libplist-master”), build/install
(“./autogen.sh ; make ; sudo make install”). This will probably install
libplist-2.0.* in /usr/local/lib.</p>
<p><em>(Ignore the following for builds on MacOS:)</em> On some systems
like Debian or Ubuntu, you may also need to add a missing entry
<code>/usr/local/lib</code> in /etc/ld.so.conf (or place a file
containing “/usr/local/lib/libplist-2.0.so” in /etc/ld.so.conf.d) and
then run “sudo ldconfig”.</p>

<p>This project makes use of a third-party GPL library for handling

<p>Given the large number of third-party AirPlay receivers (mostly
closed-source) available for purchase, it is my understanding that an

<p><em>[adapted from fdraschbacher’s notes on RPiPlay
antecedents]</em></p>
<p>The code in this repository accumulated from various sources over
time. Here is an attempt at listing the various authors and the
components they created:</p>
<p>UxPlay was initially created by <strong>antimof</strong> from
RPiPlay, by replacing its Raspberry-Pi-adapted OpenMAX video and audio
rendering system with GStreamer rendering for desktop Linux systems
(antimof’s work on code in <code>renderers/</code> was later backported
to RPiPlay).</p>
<p>The previous authors of code included in UxPlay by inheritance from
RPiPlay include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EstebanKubata</strong>: Created a FairPlay library called <a
href="https://github.com/EstebanKubata/playfair">PlayFair</a>. Located
in the <code>lib/playfair</code> folder. License: GNU GPL</li>
<li><strong>Juho Vähä-Herttua</strong> and contributors: Created an
AirPlay audio server called <a
href="https://github.com/juhovh/shairplay">ShairPlay</a>, including
support for Fairplay based on PlayFair. Most of the code in
<code>lib/</code> originally stems from this project. License: GNU
LGPLv2.1+</li>
<li><strong>dsafa22</strong>: Created an AirPlay 2 mirroring server <a
href="https://github.com/dsafa22/AirplayServer">AirplayServer</a> (seems
gone now), for Android based on ShairPlay. Code is preserved <a
href="https://github.com/jiangban/AirplayServer">here</a>, and <a
href="https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay/wiki/AirPlay2">see here</a> for the
description of the analysis of the AirPlay 2 mirror protocol that made
RPiPlay possible, by the AirplayServer author. All code in
<code>lib/</code> concerning mirroring is dsafa22’s work. License: GNU
LGPLv2.1+</li>
<li><strong>Florian Draschbacher</strong> (FD-) and contributors:
adapted dsafa22’s Android project for the Raspberry Pi, with extensive
cleanups, debugging and improvements. The project <a
href="https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay">RPiPlay</a> is basically a port of
dsafa22’s code to the Raspberry Pi, utilizing OpenMAX and OpenSSL for
better performance on the Pi. License GPL v3. FD- has written an
interesting note on the history of <a
href="http://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay#airplay-protocol-versions">Airplay
protocol versions</a>, available at the RPiPlay github repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Independent of UxPlay, but used by it and bundled with it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fedor Indutny</strong> (of Node.js, and formerly Joyent,
Inc) and contributors: Created an http parsing library called <a
href="https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp">llhttp</a>. Located at
<code>lib/llhttp/</code>. License: MIT</li>
</ul>
